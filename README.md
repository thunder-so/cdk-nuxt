Deploy full-stack Nuxt applications on AWS with CI/CD.

AWS resources:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) with [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for dynamic content generation
- Fast responses from [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- Automatic upload of the build files and static assets to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with optimized caching rules
- Publicly available by a custom domain (or subdomain) via [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and SSL via [Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
- Build and deploy with [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- Optional: Use Dockerfile to use container image Lambda

## Prerequisites

You need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) to create and deploy the required resources for the site on AWS.

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
  - Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or later) and npm installed.
  - AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface.

  - AWS CDK: Install the AWS CDK globally
```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

  - Before deploying, bootstrap your AWS environment:
```
cdk bootstrap aws://your-aws-account-id/us-east-1
```

This package uses the `npm` package manager and is an ES6+ Module.


## Installation

Navigate to your project directory and install the package and its required dependencies. 

Your `package.json` must also contain `tsx` and the latest version of `aws-cdk-lib`:

```bash
npm i tsx aws-cdk-lib @thunderso/cdk-nuxt --save-dev
```

## Configuration

Create the required CDK stack entrypoint at `stack/index.ts`. You should adapt the file to your project's needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Use different filenames such as `production.ts` and `testing.ts` for environments.

```ts
// stack/index.ts
import { App } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { NuxtStack, type NuxtProps } from "@thunderso/cdk-nuxt";

const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  env: {
    account: 'your-account-id',
    region: 'us-east-1'
  },
  application: 'your-application-id',
  service: 'your-service-id',
  environment: 'production',

  rootDir: '', // supports monorepos. e.g. app/

  // ... other props
};

new NuxtStack(
    new App(), 
    `${nuxtApp.application}-${nuxtApp.service}-${nuxtApp.environment}-stack`, 
    nuxtApp
);
```

Update your `nuxt.config.ts` to include the optimal settings for deployment on AWS:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  /// ... other configs

  vite: {
    vue: {
      script: {
        defineModel: true,
        propsDestructure: true,
      },
    },
    build: {
        target: 'esnext',
    }
  },

  nitro: {
    preset: 'aws-lambda',
    esbuild: {
        options: {
            target: 'esnext'
        },
    }
  },
});
```

- Vite is a fast frontend build tool that improves development speed and optimizes builds, especially for frameworks like Vue and Nuxt. The vite options enable advanced Vue features (`defineModel`, `propsDestructure`), set the build target to modern JavaScript (`esnext`),

- Nitro is Nuxt's server engine, responsible for building and deploying server-side code. The nitro options set the deployment target to AWS Lambda (`preset: 'aws-lambda'`) and ensure server code is also built for modern JavaScript (`esnext`), improving performance and compatibility with AWS environments.

## Deploy

Run `npm run build` before you deploy.

By running the following script, the CDK stack will be deployed to AWS.

```bash
npx cdk deploy --require-approval never --all --app="npx tsx stack/index.ts" 
```

## Destroy the Stack

If you want to destroy the stack and all its resources (including storage, e.g., access logs), run the following script:

```bash
npx cdk destroy --require-approval never --all --app="npx tsx stack/index.ts" 
```


# Deploy using GitHub Actions

In your GitHub repository, add a new workflow file under `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yaml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Nuxt to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or the branch you want to deploy from

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          npx cdk deploy --require-approval never --all --app="npx tsx stack/index.ts"
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: 'us-east-1'  # or your preferred region
```

Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as repository secrets in GitHub. These should be the access key and secret for an IAM user with permissions to deploy your stack.


# Manage Domain with Route53

1. [Create a hosted zone in Route53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) for the desired domain, if you don't have one yet.

  This is required to create DNS records for the domain to make the app publicly available on that domain. On the hosted zone details you should see the `Hosted zone ID` of the hosted zone.

2. [Request a public global certificate in the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) for the desired domain in `us-east-1` *(global)* and validate it, if you don't have one yet.

  This is required to provide the app via HTTPS on the public internet. Take note of the displayed `ARN` for the certificate. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The certificate must be issued in `us-east-1` *(global)* regardless of the region used for the app itself as it will be attached to the CloudFront distribution which works globally.

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props

  // Optional: Domain settings
  // - create a hosted zone for your domain in Route53
  // - issue a global tls certificate in us-east-1 in AWS ACM
  domain: 'sub.example.com',
  hostedZoneId: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
  globalCertificateArn: 'arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234',
};
```

# Configure the Lambda

Each configuration property provides a means to fine-tune your functionâ€™s performance and operational characteristics.

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props
  
  serverProps: {
    runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
    architecture: Architecture.ARM_64,
    memorySize: 1792,
    timeout: 10,
    tracing: false,
    exclude: ['**/*.ts', '**/*.map'],
  },
};

```

### `runtime`
Specifies the runtime environment for the Lambda function, determining which Lambda runtime API versions are available to the function.
- **Type**: `Runtime`
- **Examples**: `Runtime.NODEJS_20_X`, `Runtime.NODEJS_22_X`
- **Default**: The runtime defaults to `Runtime.NODEJS_20_X`.

### `architecture`
Defines the instruction set architecture that the Lambda function supports.
- **Type**: `Architecture`
- **Examples**: `Architecture.ARM_64`, `Architecture.X86_64`
- **Default**: The architecture defaults to `Architecture.ARM_64`.

### `memorySize`
The amount of memory, in MB, allocated to the Lambda function.
- **Type**: `number`
- **Usage Example**: `memorySize: 512`
- **Default**: 1792 MB

### `timeout`
The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda will terminate the running function.
- **Type**: `number`
- **Usage Example**: `timeout: 15`
- **Default**: 10 seconds

### `tracing`
Enables or disables AWS X-Ray tracing for the Lambda function.
- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Usage Example**: `tracing: true`
- **Default**: `false`

### `exclude`
Lists the file patterns that should be excluded from the Lambda deployment package.
- **Type**: `string[]`
- **Usage Example**: `exclude: ['*.test.js', 'README.md']`
- **Default**: []

## Environment variables

You can define environment variables for your Nuxt server Lambda function using the `serverProps.environment` property in your stack configuration. This allows you to inject runtime configuration, secrets, or API keys into your Nuxt application at deployment time.

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props

  serverProps: {
    // ...other server props

    environment: [
      { NUXT_API_URL: 'https://api.example.com' },
      { NUXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID: 'UA-XXXXXX' }
    ],
  },
};
```

> [!NOTE]
> Be cautious when using environment variables. Ensure that any API keys or secrets included are safe to commit to your repository.


# Advanced: Using Docker Container

If your Nuxt server bundle exceeds the AWS Lambda deployment package size limit (250 MB unzipped), you can deploy your application as a Lambda function packaged in a Docker container. 

Lambda with container images supports up to 10 GB, making it suitable for large Nuxt server bundles and dependencies.

When to use:

- Your `.output/server` directory or dependencies are too large for a standard Lambda deployment.
- You need custom OS-level dependencies or binaries.
- You want full control over the runtime environment.

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project directory. 

```Dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs:22

# Set working directory to /var/task/
WORKDIR ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}

# Copy .output/server directory contents to /var/task/
COPY ./ ./

# Lambda function handler
ENV HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=3000
EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["index.handler"]
```

The `.output/server` directory is used as the context for the container.

Reference the `Dockerfile` in your stack configuration:

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props
  
  serverProps: {
    dockerFile: 'Dockerfile'

    // ...other server props
    // note: runtime will be ignored when using Docker
  },

};

```

Deploy as usual. CDK will build the Docker image and deploy it to AWS Lambda as a container image.


# Controlling S3 Asset Uploads

You can control which files and folders from your Nuxt build output directory (`.output/public`) are uploaded to S3 by using the `buildProps` options. This is useful for optimizing your deployment by only uploading necessary static assets and excluding unnecessary files (such as source maps, test files, or other artifacts).

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props

  buildProps: {
    // Only include .js, .css, and .html files
    include: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css', '**/*.html'],
    // Exclude source maps and test files
    exclude: ['**/*.map', '**/*.test.js'],
  },
};
```

- `include`: Lists the file patterns that should be excluded from the S3 deployment package.
- `exclude`: An array of glob patterns specifying which files to exclude from the upload. Exclusions are applied after inclusions.


# Advanced: Configuring CloudFront

## Custom Error Page

You can specify a custom error page to handle `404 Not Found` errors by setting the `errorPagePath` property. This path should be relative to your application's output directory.

```ts stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props

  // Optional: Custom error page
  errorPagePath: '/404.html', // Relative to the output directory. Defaults to '/index.html'.
};
```

## Custom Headers

You can add custom HTTP response headers to all responses served by CloudFront by specifying the `headers` property in your stack configuration. These headers are automatically bound to the CloudFront Response Headers Policy, allowing you to set any custom metadata required by your application.

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props

  headers: {
    'X-App-Version': '1.0.0',
    'X-Feature-Flag': 'beta',
    'X-Request-Id': 'random-id',
  },
};
```

The headers property is an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.
All custom headers defined here will be included in the CloudFront Response Headers Policy and applied to every response.

> [!WARNING] 
> Security-related headers (such as Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, etc.) and CORS headers are managed separately by the library and cannot be overridden using the headers property. Use this property only for custom application headers.

> [!NOTE] 
> Custom headers are set at the CDN edge and are included in every response, regardless of whether the content is served from the Lambda origin or S3.


## Customize Cache Behavior 

You can fine-tune CloudFront's caching behavior by specifying which `headers`, `cookies`, and `query parameters` to include or exclude in the cache key. This allows you to control how CloudFront caches content and forwards requests to the origin, improving cache efficiency and ensuring dynamic content is handled correctly.

```ts
// stack/index.ts
const nuxtApp: NuxtProps = {
  // ... other props

  // Customize cache behavior
  allowHeaders: ['Accept-Language', 'User-Agent'],
  allowCookies: ['session-*', 'user-preferences'],
  allowQueryParams: ['lang', 'theme'],
  // Or, to exclude specific query parameters
  // denyQueryParams: ['utm_source', 'utm_medium', 'fbclid'],
};
```

- `allowHeaders`: An array of header names to include in the cache key and forward to the origin.
- `allowCookies`: An array of cookie names to include in the cache key and forward to the origin.
- `allowQueryParams`: An array of query parameter names to include in the cache key and forward to the origin.
- `denyQueryParams`: An array of query parameter names to exclude from the cache key and not forward to the origin.

If neither `allowQueryParams` nor `denyQueryParams` are specified, all query parameters are ignored in caching and not forwarded to the origin.

> [!NOTE]
> The `allowQueryParams` and `denyQueryParams` properties are mutually exclusive. If both are provided, denyQueryParams will be ignored.
